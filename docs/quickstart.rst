Quick Start
===========

To start using ``Propulate``, the first step is to install it using ``pip``. We recommend to install ``Propulate`` in a
separate ``Python3`` virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m venv ./propulate
    $ source ./propulate/bin/activate
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install propulate

This will install the ``Propulate`` optimizer functionality along with some basic example scripts to get you started.
You can find those scripts in the Github repository's `subfolder`_ ``scripts/``.

``Propulate`` has more functionality and configurable options available, to accomodate various use cases and workflows.
To learn more about how to use ``Propulate`` and adapt it to your needs, check out the :ref:`usage` section of the
documentation |:raised_hands:|.
