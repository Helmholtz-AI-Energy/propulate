Algorithms Explained
====================

``Propulate``'s centerpiece is a *fully asynchronous* parallelization and communication scheme for population-based
optimization algorithms. Our *lazy synchronization* approach enables massive parallelism while minimizing idle times and
thus energy waste on modern supercomputers.

Click one of the items below to obtain a short introduction to population-based optimization algorithms or find out how ``Propulate``'s
innovative parallelization scheme works.
