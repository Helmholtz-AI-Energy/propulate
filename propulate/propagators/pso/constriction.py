    Instead of an inertia factor that affects the old velocity value within the velocity update,
    there is a constriction factor, that is applied on the new velocity `after' the update.

    This propagator runs on Particle-class objects.

        Applies the constriction PSO update rule.

        Returns a Particle object that contains the updated values of the youngest passed Particle or Individual that
        belongs to the worker the propagator is living on.

        Parameters
        ----------
        individuals: List[Individual]
                     A list of individuals that must at least contain one individual that belongs to the propagator.
                     This list is used to calculate personal and global best of the particle and the swarm and to
                     then update the particle based on the retrieved results.
                     Individuals that cannot be used as Particle class objects are copied to particles before going on.

        Returns
        -------
        propulate.population.Particle
            An updated Particle.
